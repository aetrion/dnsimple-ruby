client = Dnsimple::Client.new(access_token: "a1b2c3")

# Fetch your details
response = client.identity.whoami   # execute the call
response.data                       # extract the relevant data from the response or
client.identity.whoami.data         # execute the call and get the data in one line

# Define an account ID.
account_id = 1010

# You can also fetch it from the whoami response
# as long as you authenticate with an Account access token
whoami = client.identity.whoami.data
account_id = whoami.user.id

# List your domains
puts client.domains.list_domains(account_id).data                      # => domains from the account 1234, first page
puts client.domains.list_domains(account_id, query: { page: 3 }).data  # => domains from the account 1234, third page
puts client.domains.all_domains(account_id).data                       # => all domains from the account 1234 (use carefully)

# Create a domain
response = client.domains.create_domain(account_id, name: "example.com")
puts response.data

# Get a domain
response = client.domains.domain(account_id, "example.com")
