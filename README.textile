A Ruby command line utility and wrapper for the DNSimple API.

DNSimple is a hosted DNS service that can be found at "http://dnsimple.com/":http://dnsimple.com/

h2. Installation

<pre><code>[sudo] gem install dnsimple-ruby</code></pre>

h2. Credentials

Create a file in your home directory called .dnsimple

In this file add the following:

<pre><code>username: YOUR_USERNAME
password: YOUR_PASSWORD
</code></pre>

Alternatively you can pass the credentials via command-line arguments, as in:

<pre><code>dnsimple -u username -p password list</code></pre>

h2. Commands

There are two ways to interact with the DNSimple Ruby wrapper. The first is
to use the command line utility that is included.

The commands available are as follows:

For help:

* dnsimple help

The following commands are available for domains:

* dnsimple list
* dnsimple describe domain.com
* dnsimple create domain.com
* dnsimple register domain.com registrant_id
* dnsimple transfer domain.com registrant_id [authinfo]
* dnsimple delete domain.com
* dnsimple apply domain.com template_short_name

Please note that domain registration and transfer can only be done through the API for domains that do not require extended attributes. A future version of the API will add support for extended attributes.

The following commands are available for records:

* dnsimple record:create [--prio=priority] domain.com name type content [ttl]
* dnsimple record:list domain.com
* dnsimple record:delete domain.com record_id

The following commands are available for custom templates:

* dnsimple template:list
* dnsimple template:create name short_name [description]
* dnsimple template:delete short_name
* dnsimple template:list_records short_name
* dnsimple template:add_record short_name name type content [ttl] [prio]
* dnsimple template:delete_record short_name template_record_id

The following commands are available for managing contacts:

The following commands are available for listing services and adding and removing them from domains

* service:list
* service:describe short_name

h2. Wrapper Classes

In addition to the command line utility you may also use the included Ruby
classes directly in your Ruby applications.

Sample:

<pre><code>
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'dnsimple'
  
  DNSimple::Client.username   = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
  DNSimple::Client.password   = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
  DNSimple::Client.http_proxy = {}

  user = DNSimple::User.me
  puts "#{user.domain_count} domains"

  puts "Domains..."
  DNSimple::Domain.all.each do |domain|
    puts "  #{domain.name}"
  end

  domain = DNSimple::Domain.find("example.com")
  domain.apply("template") # applies a standard or custom template to the domain

  domain = DNSimple::Domain.create("newdomain.com")
  puts "Added #{domain.name}"
  domain.delete # removes from DNSimple
</pre></code>
